Hey! For the practice game, we've decided to give you guys a very basic example of what a drivetrain might look like.

You'll see two main methods here:
    - rotate()
    - drive()

I will explain how everything works along the way. Later (in the practice game or in the real season), you can build a better one.

Some things you'll want in a drivetrain that this one can't do include:
    - Driving and turning at the same time
    - Driving sideways (yes this is possible its very cool we have cool wheels for this :) )
    - More stuff but I can't think of anything rn

I won't explain the basics of java, but i will explain FTC-programming. I'd recommend having some prior programming knowledge (of stuff like variables, functions, etc.) but being a Java expert isn't necessary.

        //IMPORTANT: if you notice the robots wheels are not turning in the direction you expected, it is probably because of the fact you used gears in your robot. This can make the turning-direction flip, so if thats the case, just put a "-" before "speed" for the motor having problems
    }

    //The method drive() is a lot like rotate()
